Font installation

    This script has no special font handling; the font names are hard coded.
    If a font cannot be found, a system default is used, which will work but
    look different. The defaults are 'Arial' for normal sizes and 'Fixed' for
    the smallest size.

    If you use fontconfig, it may be that bitmap fonts are not considered at
    all, so check its configuration. If bitmap fonts are not globally installed
    look for a file 4x6.pcf.gz and copy it to ~/.fonts/ .
